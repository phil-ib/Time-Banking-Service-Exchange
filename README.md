# Time Banking Service Exchange (TBSE)

A decentralized platform built on Stacks blockchain for community members to exchange services based on time contributions. Users can offer skills, request services, and earn time credits through community participation.

## üêõ Recent Bug Fix

### Issue Resolved
The contract had several Clarity language compliance issues that were preventing successful compilation:

1. **Invalid `when` function usage**: The contract was using `when` statements which are not part of the Clarity language specification
2. **Missing `min` function**: Attempted to use a non-existent `min` function for reputation score calculations
3. **Type mismatches in conditional statements**: Mixed return types in `if` statements

### Fixes Applied
- **Replaced `when` with `if`**: All instances of `when` were replaced with proper `if` conditional statements
- **Implemented custom min logic**: Replaced `min()` function with conditional expression: `(if (> value max) max value)`
- **Fixed type consistency**: Ensured all conditional branches return the same type

### Code Changes
```clarity
;; Before (Invalid)
(when (> refund-amount u0)
  (map-set users ...)
)

;; After (Valid)
(if (> refund-amount u0)
  (map-set users ...)
  true
)
```

```clarity
;; Before (Invalid)
reputation-score: (min (+ (get reputation-score endorsed-user) u2) u100)

;; After (Valid)
reputation-score: (if (> (+ (get reputation-score endorsed-user) u2) u100) 
                   u100 
                   (+ (get reputation-score endorsed-user) u2))
```
